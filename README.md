A scheduler for your day to day work-life. 

# Authors 
- Kole Dallam

# Built Using
- HTML - Skeleton of the website.
- CSS - Used for styling.
- JavaScript - Used for the actual functionality of the project.
- Bootstrap - Used for some different customizations.

#   Trials I Experienced
- I orginally wrote a little bit more complicated JavaScript, however I could't get it to function properly so I got help from a classmate.
- I misspelt a couple things as well which caused my javascript and html to toss errors back and fourth. 
- The creation of the timeblocks was a little difficult, but also soon I realized I didnt link my java file to my html so none of my javascript was working because the file path was wrote wrong.
